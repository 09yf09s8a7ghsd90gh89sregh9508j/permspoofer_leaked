## 🚀 **Usage Instructions**

### 1. 🌐 **Spoof Network Information**
- **Press F1**  
- **Description**: This function temporarily alters your device’s network configuration (IP address, DNS settings, etc.) to enhance privacy by making your network activity harder to trace.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for use in public or unsecured networks where privacy is a concern.
- **Note**: Your network configuration will return to the default after a system restart.

### 2. 🔢 **Check Serial Numbers**
- **Press F2**  
- **Description**: This function checks and displays the serial numbers of your system's hardware components (e.g., motherboard, network adapter) for identification and diagnostic purposes.
- **Use Case**: Helpful for troubleshooting hardware issues or confirming the integrity of hardware during system diagnostics.
- **Note**: Serial numbers will be displayed in a readable format for easy cross-reference.

### 3. 🔄 **Change MAC Address**
- **Press F3**  
- **Description**: This function allows you to change your device’s MAC address temporarily for network management, privacy, or troubleshooting purposes.
- **Use Case**: Useful for bypassing MAC address-based network restrictions or ensuring greater anonymity while using public networks.
- **Note**: The new MAC address will remain active until your system is restarted.
